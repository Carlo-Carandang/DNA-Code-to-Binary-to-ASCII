# From DNA Code to Binary to ASCII- A Message from God?
Coding challenge from Clinical Developers Group

You are working with a team of genetics researchers. You're told the exciting and confusing news that there may be a message from God hidden in our DNA! Through science and prayer your team has been able to work out the following:
* The message is hidden somewhere in the attached sequence of ~120,000 base pairs
* God writes in stochastic binary, with 0 represented by either A or C, and 1 represented by either T or G
* God encodes in ASCII
Can you find the message?

Hints:
* Convert DNA code to binary, then to ASCII, and analyze to find the message from God!
* Frameshifts can occur
